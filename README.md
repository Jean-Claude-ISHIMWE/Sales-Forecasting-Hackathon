# Sales-Forecasting-Hackathon

Here's your ticket to the numbers world, coffee, and a pinch of black magic—aka, our **Sales Forecasting Model** for the DTP Hackathon. We domesticated the notorious **Amazon Sale Report__Copy** dataset and built a model that spits out sales predictions for e-comm businesses. If ever you dreamed of knowing what's to come (at least sales-wise), you're in the right place.


## ???? Project Vision

Let's be honest: forecasting future sales is usually a best guess. So we set out to build a forecasting beast—smart, scalable, and unsettlingly accurate. With the **Prophet model** (no crystal ball, just excellent machine learning), companies can now retire the dartboard and start making smart decisions on hard fact.


 

## Features You'll Love

- **Crystal Ball Sales Forecasts:** Enter your time horizon, get the goods.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Graphs, charts, colors—click around, view your forecasts and trends.
- **Messy Data? No Problem:** We tidied up missing values, discarded useless trash, and had everything ship-shape.
- **Prophet Under the Hood:** Time-series magic, no wizard hat required.
- **Visual Overload:** Past trends, future forecasts, odd anomalies—view it all with a click.


## ????️ What's Behind the Curtain (Tech Stack)

- **Python** (because, duh)
- **Prophet** (forecasting wizardry)
- **Pandas** (data wrangler extraordinaire)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (because we want those pretty pictures)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (the playground)
- **GitHub** (because we want our code stored for backup purposes)
- **Kaggle** (where we found our treasure chest of data)


## ???? The Data Lowdown

Taken straight from Kaggle, the **Amazon Sales Report__Copy** dataset contains:
- **Order ID**
- **Date**
- **Status**
- **Sales Channel**
- **Amount**
- **Qty**
- **Ship-city**
- **Ship-country**
- .and some additional miscellaneous pieces

Rest easy, the data's already decluttered and cleaned. Prophet did the rest.


## ???? Getting Started

### Must-Haves

- Python 3.x (honestly, don't even think about using Python 2)
- Jupyter Notebook (life's too short for clunky IDEs)
- Anaconda or some virtual environment (not necessary but saves you headaches)
- GitHub (if you're going to get along with version control)

### Quick Setup

- **Clone the Repo:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Jean-Claude-ISHIMWE/Sales-Forecasting-Hackathon.git
  ```
- **Install What You Need:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- **Fire Up the Notebook:**
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
- **Run It:** Work your way through the notebook, generate predictions, and pretend like you knew all along what your sales would be.
  
## ??? How Prophet Works (No Smoke and Mirrors)

- **Step 1: Data Prep**

- Clean it up

- Take those dates and get them into a form that Prophet will recognize
- Check to make sure nothing's missing
- **Step 2: Training the Model**
- Give Prophet your historical data

- Let it do its magic while it reads about trends, seasonality, holidays, and all the other good things
- **Step 3: Predict Future
- Next 30 days (or more—crazy stuff) projections


## ???? Why This Matters So Much
- **Catch Trends:** No more "wait, why did sales drop last March?" fights.

### Expect the Impact:
See what specials, holidays, or miscellaneous stuff does to your numbers.
- **Inventory Tranquility:** Shelf stock (not too hidden)
- **Smart Business Decisions:** Decision-making via data = less stress, more success.

## ???? Need the Data?
- Clone it from [Kaggle here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karkavelrajaj/amazon-sales-dataset)

- Already cleaned up and ready to go

## ???? What Next?
Swim in, bust it with responsibility, and if you enjoy it, don't forget a star on the repo. May your predictions always be in your favor!
